# The Pendulum project

The Pendulum project is building modern, full-featured implementations of the Network Time Protocol and the Precision Time Protocol. Our projects focus on security and robustness, and provide memory safety through Rust.

Statime (PTP) and ntpd-rs (NTP) are the two projects that constitute Pendulum.

## Mission

NTP and PTP are vital building blocks of the Internet and other critical infrastructure, running on millions of devices and servers. Our mission is to create memory-safe timing protocol implementations that 1) provide reliable time synchronosation and 2) are easily extensible to accomodate future timing standards improvements.

Working with the timing community and sharing our insights and knowlegde is an intregal part of that mission.

## Roadmap

- Q1 2023: NTP with NTS
- Q2 2023: PTP default profile + NTP/PTP fieldtest
- Q3/Q4 2023: Adoption work (ntpd-rs) and new features 

Have a look at the [Statime](https://github.com/pendulum-project/statime) and [ntpd-rs](https://github.com/memorysafety/ntpd-rs) projects for more details about their roadmaps.

## Support us

We seek funding for the continuation of our effort. Financial stability for the project is key to maintain, improve and grow adoption. We offer GitHub sponsoring options, and are happy to talk about custom sponsoring arrangements or about funding for specific features.

We thank [Prossimo](https://www.memorysafety.org/) and the [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/) for their substantial support for the initial development of both protocols.
